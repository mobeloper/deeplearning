    "ETL Pipelines with Prefect\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) is a platform for automating data workflows.  Data engineers and data scientists can build, test and deploy production pipelines without worrying about all of the [\"negative engineering\" aspects](https://medium.com/the-prefect-blog/positive-and-negative-data-engineering-a02cb497583d) of production.  For example, Prefect makes it easy to deploy a workflow that runs on a complicated schedule, requires task retries in the event of failures, and sends notifications when certain tasks are complete.  Prefect was built on top of Dask, and [relies on Dask](http://stories.dask.org/en/latest/prefect-workflows.html#how-dask-helps) to schedule and manage the execution of a Prefect workflow in a distributed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates running a Prefect ETL Flow on Dask which ultimately creates a GIF.  While this is a somewhat unconventional use case of Prefect, we're no strangers to [unconventional use cases](https://medium.com/the-prefect-blog/prefect-runs-on-prefect-3e6df553c3a4).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of workflow engines, Prefect supports many unique features; in this particular example we will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- parametrization of workflows\n",
    "- dynamic runtime \"mapping\" of workflow tasks\n",
    "- customizable execution logic\n",

    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how Prefect and Dask work together, we are going to build and execute a standard \"Extract / Transform / Load\" (ETL) workflow for processing some basic image data.  Most ETL workflows involve a scheduled migration of data from one database to another.  In our case, we will be moving data from a file located at a known URL to our local hard disk, converting the individual file into a series of frames, and compiling those frames into a GIF.  The URL references a file containing raw bytes such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of our workflow will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract: pull the data file from a URL (specified by a `Parameter`) to disk\n",
    "2. Transform: split the file into multiple files, each corresponding to a single frame\n",
    "3. Load: Store each frame individually, and compile the frames together into a GIF\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have built our Flow, we can execute it with different values for the `Parameter` or even run it on a nightly schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** If we planned on executing this Flow in a truly distributed environment, writing the images to the local filesystem would _not_ be appropriate.  We would instead use an external datastore such as Google Cloud Storage, or a proper database."

    "\n",
    "First, we will define our tasks for _extracting_ the image data file from a given URL and saving it to a given file location.  To do so, we will utilize two methods for creating Prefect Tasks:\n",
    "- the `task` decorator for converting any Python function into a task\n",
    "- a pre-written, configurable Task from the [Prefect \"Task Library\"](https://docs.prefect.io/guide/task_library/) which helps us abstract some standard boilerplate\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will utilize the following Prefect concepts:\n",
    "- a [Prefect signal](https://docs.prefect.io/guide/core_concepts/execution.html#state-signals) for marking this task and its downstream depedencies as successfully \"Skipped\" if the file is already present in our local filesystem\n",
    "- retry semantics: if, for whatever reason, our `curl` command fails to connect, we want it to retry up to 2 times with a 10 second delay.  This way, if we run this workflow on a schedule we won't need to concern ourselves with temporary intermittent connection issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we are simply defining our individual tasks - we won't actually set up our dependency structure until we create the full Flow."
